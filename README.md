Rotoforge generates bitmasks (grayscale images which show how much a pixel is part of a mask) based on prompts which the user provides. It can both generate masks for images and video.



## Versions and compatibility

Tested on:

* 3.6

Older versions or custom blender forks probably work, just didn't test them.
